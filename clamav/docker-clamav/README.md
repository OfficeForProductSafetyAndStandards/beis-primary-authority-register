# Docker ClamAV

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UKHomeOffice/docker-clamav.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UKHomeOffice/docker-clamav)

Docker container for starting a [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/) daemon.

## Getting Started

These instructions will cover how to start a container both in Docker and within a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this container you'll need docker installed.

* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started)
* [OS X](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/)


#### Environment Variables

The variables and the defaults are shown below.
By default, the container does not depend on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/). 

* `CLAMD_SETTINGS_CSV="LogVerbose yes,VirusEvent /custom_alert.sh"` See [clamd.conf](http://linux.die.net/man/5/clamd.conf) for more details  
  and see [./clamd.conf](./clamd.conf) for the default settings.  
  To use specify a CSV of settings as they would apear in the config file e.g. `"CLAMD_SETTINGS_CSV=Setting value"`
  Note, clamd has already been configured appropriately for a container but some useful settings include:    
  * `VirusEvent /path/to/alert_script.sh` If mounted in the container, will provide a custom alert facility
  * `LogClean yes` Will log every scan performed
* `FRESHCLAM_SETTINGS_CSV="LogVerbose yes"` See [freshclam.conf](http://linux.die.net/man/5/freshclam.conf) for more details  
  and see [./freshclam.conf](freshclam.conf) for the default settings. See above for how this works.  
* `UPDATE=true` (default) will start freshclam daemon in background to watch for update antivirus definitions  
  `UPDATE=false` will watch for first successful update from separate sidecar container before starting
* `UPDATE_ONLY=true` configure as a sidecar container and run the update process in the foreground  
  `UPDATE_ONLY=false` (default) will run clamd and freshclam as normal.  
  
#### Ports

This container exposes:

* `3310` - Access the [Clam AV API](http://linux.die.net/man/8/clamd).

## TODO:

* Ensure the DB access doesn't need to be for user 999 (so the volume can be mounted)...
* Long startup time, see point above.
* Add testing for Travis
