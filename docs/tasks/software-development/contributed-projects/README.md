# Contributed Projects

Contributed [modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module) and [themes](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme) are those created and maintained by the Drupal community. The community volunteer their time or are sponsored to keep these projects up to date.

They are managed and can be updated to their latest versions through composer.

## Making changes

To make changes to a project, to fix a bug, or to request a new feature the following steps must be taken:

1. An issue must be opened on the [project's issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/community/contributor-guide/reference-information/quick-info/find-the-issues-for-a-project) (you must have an account and be signed in to drupal.org)
2. A discussion is sometimes required to agree the best approach
3. Changes must be made to an [issue fork](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-gitlab-to-contribute-to-drupal/creating-issue-forks)
4. A [merge request](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-gitlab-to-contribute-to-drupal/creating-merge-requests) must be made for this issue fork
5. Ask the maintainer to review and commit these changes, this may require discussion with other community members to achieve the right results

**Note:** Changes to contributed projects can take time to be discussed, reviewed, tested and committed as these are all done by volunteers. 

**Note:** Some projects are more maintained more actively than others.
