# PAR Roles
This module is intended to define the basic roles for all PAR Users, not just transition.

It is also responsible for funneling each user down the correct user journeys once they log in.

It is also responsible for making sure that user accounts and PAR People records are linked up and always maintain that relationship when created, updated or deleted.
