# PAR Styleguide
This module is intended to create the necessary pages and templates needed to show off the components that will be styled in the GOV.UK theme.

### What should it do?
This module should create the basic styleguide pages and templates.

### What should it not do?
This module should not contain any styles or UI assets. These should be responsibilities of any GOV.UK theme.

### Why are we creating these pages?
To make it easier to test regression on all elements of the GOV.UK theme.
