# PAR Pagination
This module is intended to expose a Views pager plugin.

### What should it do?
This module should allow a custom Pager named "Paged output, full GDS styled pager".

### What should it not do?
This module should not contain any styles or UI assets. These should be responsibilities of any GOV.UK theme.

### Why is this needed?
The Drupal Views out the box pager does not meet the GDS style requirements. This provides the correct markup which then inherits the theming.
