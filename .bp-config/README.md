Cloud Foundry Buildpack Configuration
======================================
We are using the PHP Buildpack because PaaS provide the most support for standard buildpacks https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/guidance.html#responsibility-model

The PHP buildpack can be configured and customised, more information on this can be found here:
