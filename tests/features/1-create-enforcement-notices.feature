        # CREATE ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION

        When I create new valid enforcement notification "<Notification Title>" for organisation "<Organisation>"

        # CHECK ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION EMAILS

        Then the "enforcement creation" email confirmations for "<PARUser>" are processed

    Examples:
        | Notification Title      | Organisation   | PARUser                   |
        | Enforcement notice 1    | Charlie's Cafe | par_authority@example.com |
        | Enforcement notice 2    | Charlie's Cafe | par_authority@example.com |
        | Enforcement notice 3    | Charlie's Cafe | par_authority@example.com |
        | Enforcement notice 4    | Charlie's Cafe | par_authority@example.com |
