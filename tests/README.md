End-to-End Testing with Nightwatch and Cucumber.  Nightwatch is a browser automation framework component, supporting many browsers (inlcuding Electron). Tests are coded in Nodejs, and run against a Selenium/WebDriver server. API testing is also supported. Another key component is FakerJS, for test data generation.

```
$ npm install
```

```

To run tests in parallel:

```
$ node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -c ./nightwatch-cucumber-parallel.conf.js
```

To run by tag

```
$ node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -c ./nightwatch-cucumber-parallel.conf.js -- --tag tagname
```

#### Examples

Direct partnership related tests
```
$ node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -c ./nightwatch-cucumber-parallel.conf.js -- --tag directpartnership
```
Coordinated partnership related tests
```
$ node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -c ./nightwatch-cucumber-parallel.conf.js -- --tag coordinatedpartnership
