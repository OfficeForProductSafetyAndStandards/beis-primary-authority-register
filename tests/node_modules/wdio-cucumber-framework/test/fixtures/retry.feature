Feature: Example feature
  As a test script of wdio-cucumber-framework
  I should pass if I understand how to retry failed step definitons

  Scenario: Foo Bar Doo
    Given I set retryTest to "1"
    And   I go on the website "http://webdriver.io" that can fail one time
    Then  the last command should be "url"

  Scenario: Next Foo Bar
    Given I set retryTest to "2"
    Then  should the title of the page be "Google"
    And   the last command should be "getTitle"

  Scenario: Async Foo Bar
    Given I set retryTest to "3"
    And   I go on the website "foobar" the async way
    Then  the last command should be "url"

  Scenario: Next async Foo Bar
    Given I set retryTest to "2"
    Then  I click on link "foobar" the async way
    Then  the last command should be "click"
